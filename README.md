# Seizure-Detection-Using-LSTM-CNN
Applying deep learning entirely to the raw EEG records for achieving multiclass classification task between interictal, ictal and normal brain states. By using 1D-DCNN and LSTM as a backend, we acieved high accuracy without any hand-crafted feature extraction. Due to limitted dataset, Augmentation technique is used to generalize better.
